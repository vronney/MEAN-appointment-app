## Tools Used

- Angular 9
- Angular Material
- Mongo
- Express

## Purpose

Created a `MEAN stack app` which allowed users to fill out a simple form to submit their date to book an appointment.

First started by building the `Express` backend that configures a few endpoints for retrieving, saving, and removing data from the MongoDB collection via some simple `CRUD` operations.

Then, moved on teh creating the `Angular` front-end which consisted of the display of the appointments data in a list and also to add new appointments, using `Angular Material`.
